A blank slate
A blank stare
A buggers muddle
A case-by-case basis
A celebration of illumination
A chip off the old block
A complete non sequitur
A creeping appeasement 
A dark day in history
A degree of surreality
A dignified silence
A done deal
A drama out of a crisis 
A fair crack of the whip
A fair sup of the Sav
A flagrant flourish
A good fighting chance
A guilty plea
A head-of-steam on this one
A hollow victory
A huge debt of gratitude
A kings ransom
A large spoon of concrete
A life lived full
A Likely Lad
A likely yarn
A load of mumbo-jumbo
A majority of one
A majority of won
A malign influence
A miscreants delight
A nest of vipers
A new lease in life
A new world order
A pack of lies
A pig and a poke
A purse of four
A pursuit of happiness
A rude awakening
A shot in the dark
A slap in the face
A spanner in the works
A standing ovation
A stroke of genius
A struggle for legitimacy
A tall order
A theme of vicarious liability
A Towering Inferno
A very long short
A wasp suing a monkey
A worlds first
A blessing in disguise
A case-by-case basis 
A likely yarn
A whimpering police dog
Absolute cobblers
Absolute train-wreck
Absolutely four-square
Accept it at face-value
Across the finish line
Adhere to the oath of office
Affidavit avalanche
Afraid to say boo to a goose
Against All Odds
Ahead of the curve
Ain't over till its over
All at sea
All done n dusted
All guns blazing
All on the goodness of time
All things being equal
All over Red Rover
Alls well that ends well
Already had my compliment
Always look for the silver lining
An about-face
An axe to grind
An elaborate hoaxer
An honorable recalcitrant
An invisible touch
An old battleaxe
"And just like that, she was gone"
And that's saying something
Answer to a maiden's prayer
Applied for chiltern 100s
Approaching the final furlong
As fate will have it
As good as it gets
As I think to myself
As rich as Croesus
Ask and you shall receive
At the drop of a hat
At the Ops briefing
Atone for your sins
Attacked on all fronts/Flanks

Back amongst the frey
Back in the day
Back on the straight and narrow
Back up the truck
Bang out of order
Barking mad
Bats in the Belfry
Be the change
Becoming sidetracked
Been collared
Been sent to Coventry
Before I set the ball rolling
Beggar thy neighbour
Beggars banquet
Beggars belief
Behind the curve every step of the way
Bet your bottom dollar
Better late than never
Better safe than sorry
Better the devil you know
Better to give than to receive

Can go whistle for it
Cards on the table
Cat on a hot tin roof
Caught in a landslide
Caught in the crossfire
Caught in two minds
Challenging the optimism
Changed their modus operandi
Chaotic contradictory and confusing
Cheats never prosper
Chickens come home to roost

Chuffed to bits

Develop a sense of urgency
Devil and the deep blue sea
Did I say that out loud
Didn't butter my parsnips
Didn't realise the severity of it all
Different kettle of fish
Diversified to buggery
Diving off the deep end
"Dockhands, sailors, river pirates, and errant swells"
Doesn't have to be that way
Dont drink & drive
Dont want to step on your toes
Down the yellow brick road
Dream come true
Dropping like flies
Dull as dishwater
Eager eyes to spot the errant serpents nest
Eager to please
Early to rise
Easy pickings
Echoing our favorite advocate
Education means to lead out
Either a daring adventure or nothing
Embodiment of absent virtues
Empty shell

Enough is enough
Enough's enough

Every man for themself
Ex post facto
Exception that proves the rule
Exercised amazing constraint
Expecting their marching orders
Eye of newt and toe of frog
Eye on the prize
Eye-rolling reaction
Eyes in the back of her head
Face the facts
Falling on deaf ears
False positives false negatives
Feeling the pangs of guilt
Fight fire with fire
Fight of our lives
Fighting fire with fire

Firing on all cylinders
First among equals
First to the finish line
Flash in the pan
Fleet beats mean
Flexible moral compass
Flush is already busted
Fly in the ointment
Fly under the radar
Flying in the face of convention
Following a line of inquiry
Food for thought
Foot in the mangle
For crying out loud
For fear of Government overreach
For love nor money
For Petes sake
For richer for poorer
For the love of it
For the sake of argument
For whom the Bell tolls
Force of habit
Forge ahead with this
From newcross to Seattle 
Full of false hope
Game of Gowns
Generated more heat than light 
Get it in the neck
Get me off this carousel
Get off the carousel
Get stuck in
Get this place ship-shape
Getting a bum rap
Getting away with murder
Getting past the impasse
Giant leap into the unknown
Give him a wide berth
Give them my brown crown
Give up the ghost
Given a fair crack of the whip
Given a wide berth
Glossing over it
Go to ground
Going hell for leather
Gone to hell in a handbasket
Good point - well made
Good times will come again
Got life in them yet
Got them rattled
Got to be on your game
Got to earn my keep

Have a Jeffersonian purity
Have your wits about you
Hawks doves and pragmatists

Headline grabber
Hello darkness my old friend
He's barking mad
He's having us on
He's pushing his luck
Hic illi dicunt esse dracones 
Hidden in the undergrowth
Highly pertinent questions
High-tide mark
Hit a vein
Hit the ball out of the park
Hoisted by their own poutard
Hold on for dear life
Honour amongst thieves
Hoping against hopes
Hoping common sense prevails
Hot under the collar
How long before the pips start squeaking
Huge swathes of
I dont want to be obsequious but
I'd do that all over again
If not why not
Ignorance as a lifeboat
Ignorance is bliss
I'll have to pull the plug
I'm afraid to say
Immaterial impertinent and irrelevant
In a moment of weakness
In flagrante delicto
In imminent danger
In it for the long haul
In mint condition
In my heart of hearts
In no uncertain terms
In sheer disbelief
In the doldrums
In the firing line
In the fog of war
In the good old days
In the grand scheme of things
In the pound seats
In their ivory towers
In through the out door
In good faith
Incompetence as a lifeboat
Incorrect in every respect
Insanity prevails
Into the fray
Irascible old so and so
Irasciblilty at its best
Irasciblilty was at the fore
Irons in the fire
It is done
It might be the reason but its not an excuse
It'll all end in tears
It's a figure of speech
It's a no-brainer
It's a non-starter
It's about individual determination
Its all about the money
Its dignity that's now dead
It's getting out of hand
It's not all smooth-sailing
Its over Red Rover
Its riveting
I've started so I'll finish
Jumping up and down
Just cant help falling in love
Just get to the pit stop
Just playing catch up 
Just slapstick
Just the tip of the iceberg
Justice that they deserved
Keen to please 
Keep chipping away
Keep the home fires burning
Keeping your options open
Keeps the wolves from the door
Kicking up a fuss
King of the castle
Knocked the wind out of him
Know your adversary
Koru lounge pass
La dolce vita
Labor omnia vincit
Labour of love
Lamb to the slaughter
Lamenting his loyalty
Large fries with that
Lasting impressions
Laying down the law
Le freak - c'est chic
"Learn from yesterday, live for today"
Learning at the knee
Lesser of two evils
Less-than-ideal
Let that be a lesson for me
Let's agree to disagree
Let's put the cat among the pidgeons
Lets take a shufti
Let's take it from here
Lies by omission
Life not lived
Life on the edge of a precipice
Like a puppet on a string
Like a scalded cat
Like a tongue to an aching tooth
Like being asked by its captain if you want to get back on the Titanic
Like him or loathe him
Like hippopotamus having a race
Like lumberjacks lunacy
Live and let die
Livin the vida loca
Lockdown freedom beckons
Long and winding road
Long may this continue
Long story short
Lord of the strings
Losing the plot
Lost the plot
Lying through his teeth
Made a good fist of it
Made a pigs ear of it
Made my skin crawl
Made of sterner stuff
Made of sterner stuff than that
Made themselves fair-game
Made to inspire fervor
Making a substantial difference
Man the pumps
Manifesto promises count
Mano-a-mano diplomacy
Material gains
May the forth be with you
"Measure twice, cut once"
Meat on the bone
Minimal threat posture
Misplacement of accountability
Mission accomplished
Mitigate the severity
Mop their fevered brow
More brassy than the Benin Bronzes
More than words
More twists and turns
Much ado about nothing
Muck in your eye
My cup runneth over
My fervent belief
My fervent disbelief
My standards have slipped
"My, standards have slipped"
Need all the help they can get
New York remains the epicentre
No case to answer
No changes here
No end and no beginning
No escape from reality
No expense spared
No sailor ever learnt anything in calm seas
No sailor ever learnt anything in calm seas (Captn Lee)
No way out of the undertow 
No love lost between them
None the wiser
Not allowed to filibuster
Not exactly squeaky clean
Not much hope for cynicism
Not my cup of tea
Not over until the fat lady sings
Not the happiest camper in the campsite
"Not what you say, but how you say it"
Not worth upsetting the apple cart
Nothing has changed
Nothing like a bit of pressure to reveal character
Obnoxious little man
Of breathtaking proportions
Of you cant beat em join em
Off The Beaten Track
Off the cuff
Off the rails
Off to the races
On a bed of roses
On a hiding to nothing
On a wing and a prayer
On an even keel
On balance of probabilities
On face value
On that rare note of concord
On the back foot
On the fly
On the hoof
On the horizon
On the nose
On the right track
On the warpath
On the wings of a dove
On with the show
Once more into the fray
One of the most arresting lessons
One thing led to another
One tough cookie
One track mind
One-trick pony
Orchestrated misrepresentation
Out at all costs
Out like a light
Out of control
Over and out
Over the top
Overruled the mandate
Oxterred from the premises
Parting is such sweet sorrow
Partners in crime
Passage to India
Patriotic duty and derring-do
Pauses for thought
Pays the piper calls the tune
Peace and justice for all
Peace in our time
Pennies in the dollar
People dont think any more
Persuade them of the folly of their views
Picking up fag ends
Pie in the sky
Ping off the guy-ropes of negativity
Pit my back against the wall
Place it on hold
Placed on hold
Pliable moral compass
Polish The Lizard
Politically convenient to do this
Politically homeless
Pop your public-speaking cherry
Posh on posh
Positive outcomes
Possibly impossible
Practice makes perfect
Precedent setting
"Preemptive strike, tactical response"
Pretty sizeable effort
Principle is the last refuge of the scoundrel
Proportionate means of acheiving an objective aim
Proportionate response
Proprietary in public Office
Prosecution has a slam-dunk case
Public enemy number one
Pulling the strings
Punch and Judy episode
Pussy-footing around the issues
Put your back into it
Put your mind to it
Queen becomes pawn
Raindrops keep falling on my head
Raising the stakes
Raking over old coals
Raring to go
Read Chapter and Verse
Reading the runes
Reading the tea leaves
Ready to do-Battle
Ready when you are
Recalcitrant old geezer
Relationship between state and citizen
Remote control
Reputation is in tatters
Requests for responsibility
Resist everything except temptation
Resting on their laurels
Resurrecting paradise
Riddled with guilt
Rise and shine
Road to Damascus moment
Roll with the punches
Roll your sleeves up
Rolling back the years
Root out this evil
Rounding up the wrongdoers
Run it up the flagpole
Running up that hill
Safe as a lifeboat
Safe as houses
Said with a feigned authority
Sailing off into the sunset
Salvis iuribus
Scintillating line of journalistic enquiry
Scores on the doors
Seal the deal
Second in - a nice gin
Second to none
Second to none 
See it rent asunder
Seek and you shall find
Seeking the common ground
Seeming is what seeming does
Self-inflicted wound
Set in stone
Set playing piece
Set the precedent
Set to skyrocket
Setting sail on the high seas
Sharper than a serpent's tooth
Sharper than a tack
Shoot from the hip
Short and sweet
Shoulder to the wheel
Show good faith
Shower of bastards
Showing sheer madness
Sick it up
Signing their own deaf warrant
Since time immemorial
Singing his her praises 
Single point of contact
Slash and burn
Slavish loyalty to the cause
Slavish loyalty to the Coors
Slogan before substance
Smelling of roses
Some Kind of Wonderful
Sperrung muss beendet sein
Spine-tingling thoughts
Spinning a yarn
Spoken in a patrician drawl
Squish the sombrero
Stand and deliver
Stand to attention
Stand up and be counted
Stare decisis
Stepping into the breech
Stirring up the hornets nest
Straight as an arrow
Stranger in a strange land
Strike while the irons hot
Struck a nerve
Struck a rock with his staff
Struggling to stay relevant
Sub judice
Submersible syndicates
Subsequently transpired
Such a spoil sport
Suck it up
Suffering a flight of confidence
Sunset clause
Swanning around
Sworn to secrecy
Systems to manual
Tablettes du juif errant
Take it - to the limit - one more time
Take the rough with the smooth
Taken for granted
Taken in his/her stride
Taking centre stage
Talking undiluted hogwash
Tears in heaven
Testing the boundaries
Thar she blows
That old chestnut
That's merely conjecture
The answer wasn't exactly fulsome
The be-all and end-all
The beating heart of a nation
The burden of proof
The cards are on the table
The digger you deep [mr.JO`B]
The duplicitous duke
The edge of an abyss
The Empire strikes back
The ends justify the means
The enemy within
The error of his ways
The exception that proves the rule
The fear and isolating
The Fifth column
The fire and the fury
The firing squad
The first cut is the deepest
The first touch is the deepest
The floor is yours
The folly of their views
The Grand old Duke of York
The hapless conspirators
The Life of Riley
The light of my life
The likely lad
The majority have one
"The means , not the intent"
The Midas touch
The more the merrier
The next chapter of this story
The non sequitur fallacy
The normal course of events
The old man and the sea
The path to victory
The powers that be
The proofs in the pudding
The right noises for the wrong reasons
The show just go on
The star’s alleged proclivities
The star’s alleged proclivities 
The Voynich Manuscript
The whole shooting match
The writings on the wall
The majority have one
The Voynich Manuscript
Their indomitable will
Their voice was getting fanta
Them versus us
There are ways and means
There speaks Bob
Theres no love lost
This is life-affirming
This is not a one-and-done
This market defies the odds
This time it's for keeps
This was luck more than justice
Thought-provoking
Thousand yard stare
Throwing in the towel
Thrown in front of the bus
Tilt at unobtainable windmills
To all and sundry
To catch a thief 
To each their own
To the ends of the earth
To the heart of the matter
Tomorrow never comes
Too hot to trot
Tortured by his demons
Touch and go
Tough as old boots
Trawling digital footprints
Treading treacle
Trick up his sleeve
Tricks of the trade
Truth will out
Turn a blind eye
Turn it up
Turn the page
Turned their back on the truth
Turning a trick
Turning the other cheek
Turning the tables
Two faced
Two moods - complacency and panic
Two wrongs don't make a right
Tyrekickers of the world unite
Unbearable lightness of being
Under lock and key
Underpass parole
Unfathomable unimaginable numbers
Unions been on strike
Unrepentant and implausible
Up in flames
Urban athlete weekend warrior
Vim and vigour
Walls come tumbling down
Wall-to-wall stupidity
Wall-to-wall stupidity 
Watch this space
Ways and means
We are a tiny little outpost
We are all flawed
We are where we are
We can respectfully disagree
We dont need another hero
We'll take it from here
We-re in the running 
What a load of cobblers
What are the ground rules
What becomes of the brokenhearted
What do you make of this provision
What gets my goat
What goes up - must come down
What he thinks he becomes
What the vast majority of scientists think
Whatever floats your boat
What's done is done
What's eating Gilbert grape
What's gotten into them
What's it to you?
What's on your mind
Wheel of fortune
When push comes to shove
When push comes to shove
Where does your power lie
Who holds all the cards
Wholy guacamole
Who's really pulling the strings
Wide of the mark
Wiffle waffle piffle paffle
Wind in your sails
"Wise up, buttercup"
Wishful thinking
With a bee in his bonnet
With his hand on the tiller
With malice of forethought
With no time to dwell
Without a shadow of doubt
Without acquiescing to ratepayers
Without fear or favour
Without malice of forethought
Without prejudice
Wont butter any parsnips
Word-of-mouth
Working nine to five
Would inspire her errant journey
Wouldn't by any stretch
Wouldn't have a bar of it
Wrestling with the issues of substance
You can't beat something with nothing
You little ripper
Your gloominess is well-founded
Your own worst enemy
You've got a nerve
Zip it sweetie
